    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In the context of the curry, a Chicken Karahi is a tomato and ginger based, thick masala curry which is though to
        originate from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region. The original, authentic method of making it is a very specific
        one. As a general rule, Karahis are made from a base of ginger, garlic and tomatoes and also contain fresh green
        chillis, julienne-cut raw ginger and coriander. It's a rather thick, jammy gravy and concentrated in flavour -
        yum!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>0.5 cup oil or ghee</li>
        <li>550g chicken, bone in and cut into curry pieces</li>
        <li>600g tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 bulb garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ginger, minced</li>
        <li>1-2 tsp salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tsp paprika/kashmiri red chilli</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp crushed black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp kalonji (black seed, optional)</li>
        <li>2 green chillis, slit in half lengthwise</li>
        <li>0.5 bunch coriander, chopped</li>
        <li>0.25 cup ginger cut into matchstick pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up your oil in a karahi dish, wok, cast iron skillet or any pan suitable for stirfrying, keeping the
            flame on high for the entire duration.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken in. Fry this, stirring constantly until the chicken begins to take on a golden colour in
            some places.</li>
        <li>Add in the minced ginger and garlic. Give this a fry alongside the chicken, again stirring constantly and
            ensuring nothing burns. Continue to fry this until the raw smell of the ginger and garlic begins to fade.
        </li>
        <li>Add all the chopped tomatoes and spices. Stir in and allow this all to cook on high, stirring to ensure
            nothing catches at the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook this mix for about 20 minutes. The oil will separate, the tomatoes will thicken and begin
            to coat the chicken, and you will see holes begin to bubble in the gravy. The chicken should be cooked
            through at this point.</li>
        <li>Add the coriander and green chillis, stir in, turn the heat down to a low flame and allow everything to
            simmer together for 5 minutes without putting the lid on.</li>
        <li>Serve with the matchstick-cut ginger and additional coriander/green chilli if desired.</li>
    </ol>
