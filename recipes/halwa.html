    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gajar ka Halwa is a Pakistani/Indian dessert made using carrots and milk. It is usually garnished with nuts and
        raisins.
        <br>
        <br>
        Gajar ka Halwa is a popular dessert to serve at weddings and parties. It is considered a winter dessert due to
        the abundance of carrots available in the winter season in Pakistan/India and also due to the warming properties
        of carrots - some households make a point to cook Gajar ka Halwa at least once a year in winter.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 kg carrots</li>
        <li>3 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup ghee, 1/4 for initial sauteing and 1 for the end</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups suugar</li>
        <li>1 handful nuts, optional but highly recommended</li>
        <li>6 cardamom seeds (elaichi)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim the ends of the carrots and grate them. If you have a food processor, you can use the grater settings
            to grate the carrots (this is what I did).</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat 1/4 cup of ghee on medium heat.</li>
        <li>When heated, add the cardamom seeds and grated carrots and mix in.</li>
        <li>Allow the carrots to cook, stirring occasionally. The carrots will release A LOT of steam. We want to dry
            out the carrots as much as we can before adding the milk. This will take about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the milk. Bring to an almost-boil then reduce the heat to medium.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook, uncovered, until the milk evaporates. This may take between 2-3 hours, depending on how
            much moisture is in your carrots and on your heat. It took me 2.5 hours. Remember to stir occassionally,
            especially during the last 30 minutes when the mixture will be drier and may begin to stick to the bottom of
            the pot. If you pull the halwa to one side of the pot and see some milk release from the sides within a few
            seconds, this means the halwa is still too moist and needs more drying out.</li>
        <li>Once most of the moisture has evaporated, add in the ghee and sugar.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook on medium heat, stirring often, for about 25 minutes. You may begin to see the Halwa change
            colour to a deep autumn shade of orange and the ghee may begin to separate at the sides from the carrots -
            this is normal and what we want!</li>
        <li>When done, turn off the heat and chop in half of your nuts. Garnish with the remaining nuts.</li>
        <li>Serve warm, on it's own or with ice cream.</li>
    </ol>
