    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Originating from the province of Sindh which is now found in Pakistan, a Sindhi Biryani is an aromatic Biryani
        which differs in many ways from other Biryanis. It often (but not always!) lays its hand light on the heat and
        emphasises on the crisp flavours of mint, lemon and coriander and has a pronounced tang thanks to the dried
        plums.
        <br>
        <br>
        What also sets a Sindhi Biryani apart from others is that it uses potatoes and dried plums in the masala - other
        kinds of Biryani don't necessarily require either of these.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the biryani masala</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 small onions, sliced</li>
        <li> 10 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp freshly minced ginger</li>
        <li>0.5 cup full fat yogurt</li>
        <li>500 grams lamb or mutton, bone in</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cumin</li>
        <li>7 green cardamom</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tbsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 medium sized cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 tbsp red chilli flakes</li>
        <li>5 cloves</li>
        <li>250 grams potatoes</li>
        <li>10 dried plums</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the rice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white basmati rice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>10 green cardamoms</li>
        <li>2 black cardamoms</li>
        <li>1 bayleaf</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the garnish</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>0.5 bunch mint, chopped</li>
        <li>0.5 bunch coriander, chopped</li>
        <li>6 slices lemon</li>
        <li>6 slices tomato</li>
        <li>1 star anise</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cumin</li>
        <li>a few pinches orange/yellow food colour</li>
        <li>1 tsp kewara water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>For the potatoes</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Halve and deep fry the potatoes until they are pretty much fully cooked, but careful not to overcook them!
            Set aside for later.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the biryani masala</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a deep pot, heat the oil and add all the onions. Fry these on
            medium/high till they are golden brown. Remove 50% of these onions and
            set aside.</li>
        <li>In the pot with the remaining onions, add the minced garlic and ginger and cook till they turn golden.</li>
        <li>Add the lamb/mutton. Sear in the oil on high heat till it no longer remains pink.</li>
        <li>Add all the yogurt, dried plums and the spices. Saute this on high for a few minutes, then add about 3-4
            cups of water. Bring to a boil, cover and then cook for 1-1.5 hour, till the lamb/mutton becomes tender.
            Mutton may take up to 1hr 45 minutes to become tender, but keep checking to make sure it doesn't become too
            soft and starts falling off the bone.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is tender, add in half a bunch of chopped mint, half a bunch of chopped coriander and the
            potatoes. Stir in and turn the heat off.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the rice</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a separate pot, bring water to a boil alongside all the whole spices and the oil. There isn't a set
            amount of water - just enough for the rice to cook in. Once the water is at a boil, add in the rice and boil
            rapidly for 5-7 minutes, till the rice is 75% cooked. Drain in a colander immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assembling the biryani</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot, layer half your biryani curry/masala.</li>
        <li>The add half of your rice.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle over 2-3 pinches of food colouring and 1/2 tsp kewara water.</li>
        <li>Half of the reserved fried onions.</li>
        <li>3 slices of lemon and 3 slices of tomatoes.</li>
        <li>1/4 bunch of chopped mint and a 1/4 bunch chopped coriander.</li>
        <li>Repeat that layering process again.</li>
        <li>Now, turn the heat to the lowest possible setting, cover the Biryani and allow it to steam on low for about
            15-20 minutes. Once steamed, allow it to rest for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve with raita and salad. I also like serving my Biryani with fried raisins and cashews. Enjoy and lap up
            the compliments!</li>
    </ol>
